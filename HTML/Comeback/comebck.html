        <p>Greece,[a] officially the Hellenic Republic,[b] is a country in Southeast Europe, situated on the southern
            tip of
            the Balkan peninsula. Greece shares land borders with Albania to the northwest, North Macedonia and Bulgaria
            to
            the
            north, and Turkey to the east. The Aegean Sea lies to the east of the mainland, the Ionian Sea to the west,
            and
            the
            Sea of Crete and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. Greece has the longest coastline on the Mediterranean
            Basin,
            featuring thousands of islands. The country consists of nine traditional geographic regions, and has a
            population of
            approximately 10.5 million. Athens is the nation's capital and largest city, followed by Thessaloniki and
            Patras.</p>

        <p>Greece is considered the cradle of Western civilization, being the birthplace of democracy, Western
            philosophy,
            Western literature, historiography, political science, major scientific and mathematical principles, theatre
            and
            the Olympic Games. From the eighth century BC, the Greeks were organised into various independent
            city-states,
            known as poleis (singular polis), which spanned the Mediterranean and the Black Sea. Philip II of Macedon
            united
            most of present-day Greece in the fourth century BC, with his son Alexander the Great rapidly conquering
            much of
            the known ancient world, from the eastern Mediterranean to northwestern India. The subsequent Hellenistic
            period
            saw the height of Greek culture and influence in antiquity. Greece was annexed by Rome in the second century
            BC,
            becoming an integral part of the Roman Empire and its continuation, the Byzantine Empire, which was
            culturally
            and linguistically predominantly Greek. The Greek Orthodox Church, which emerged in the first century AD,
            helped
            shape modern Greek identity and transmitted Greek traditions to the wider Orthodox world. After falling
            under
            Ottoman rule in the mid-15th century, Greece emerged as a modern nation state in 1830 following a war of
            independence.</p>
        <h2>Name</h2>
        <p>The native name of the country in Modern Greek is Ελλάδα (Elládai, pronounced [eˈlaða]). The corresponding
            form
            in Ancient Greek and conservative formal Modern Greek (Katharevousa) is Ἑλλάς (Hellas, classical: [hel.lás],
            modern: [eˈlas]). This is the source of the English alternative name Hellas, which is mostly found in
            archaic or
            poetic contexts today. The Greek adjectival form ελληνικός (ellinikos, [eliniˈkos]) is sometimes also
            translated
            as Hellenic and is often rendered in this way in the formal names of Greek institutions, as in the official
            name
            of the Greek state, the Hellenic Republic (Ελληνική Δημοκρατία, [eliniˈci ðimokraˈti.a]).[11]</p>

        <h3><b>Premodern history</b></h3>
        <p>The oldest remains of humans in Greece is a well-preserved skull of Homo heidelbergensis from Petralona Cave
            in
            Macedonia, dating to around 250–300,000 years ago, though the estimates are highly <sub>[15]</sub> The
            Apidima
            Cave in Mani, in southern Greece, has been suggested to contain the oldest remains of anatomically modern
            humans
            outside of Africa, dated to 210,000 years ago. <sup><a href="hyy">[16]</a></sup> However, this has been
            contested, with other authors
            suggesting the remains represent archaic humans. <sup>[17] </sup>All three stages of the Stone Age
            (Paleolithic,
            Mesolithic,
            and Neolithic) are represented in Greece, for example in the Franchthi Cave. <sup>[18]</sup> Neolithic
            settlements in
            Greece, dating from the 7th millennium BC, <sub>[19] </sub>are the oldest in Europe by several centuries, as
            Greece lies on
            the route via which farming spread from the Near East to europe <sup>[20]</sup>

            Greece is home to the first advanced civilizations in Europe and is considered the birthplace of Western
            civilisation, <sub><a href="html">[21][22]</a></sub> beginning with the Cycladic civilization on the islands
            of
            the Aegean Sea at around 3200
            BC,[23] the Minoan civilization in Crete (2700–1500 BC), <sup>[24][25] </sup>and then the Mycenaean
            civilization
            on the
            mainland (1600–1100 BC). <sup><a href="tect.com">[25]</a></sup> </p>

        <h3><b>Archaic and Classical period</b></h3>
        <p>The end of the Dark Ages is traditionally dated to 776 BC, the year of the first Olympic Games.[29] The Iliad
            and
            the Odyssey, the foundational texts of Western literature, are believed to have been composed by Homer in
            the
            7th or 8th centuries BC.[30][31] With the end of the Dark Ages, there emerged various kingdoms and
            city-states
            across the Greek peninsula, which spread to the shores of the Black Sea, Southern Italy (the so-called
            "Magna
            Graecia") and Asia Minor. These states and their colonies reached great levels of prosperity that resulted
            in an
            unprecedented cultural boom, that of classical Greece, expressed in architecture, drama, science,
            mathematics
            and philosophy. In 508 BC, Cleisthenes instituted the world's first democratic system of government in
            Athens.[32][33]</p>

        <h2><b>Geography</b></h2>
        <p>Located in Southern[149] and Southeast Europe,[150] Greece consists of a mountainous, peninsular mainland
            jutting
            out into the sea at the southern end of the Balkans, ending at the Peloponnese peninsula (separated from the
            mainland by the canal of the Isthmus of Corinth) and strategically located at the crossroads of Europe,
            Asia,
            and Africa.[d] Due to its highly indented coastline and numerous islands, Greece has the 11th longest
            coastline
            in the world with 13,676 km (8,498 mi);[156] its land boundary is 1,160 km (721 mi). The country lies
            approximately between latitudes 34° and 42° N, and longitudes 19° and 30° E, with the extreme points
            being:[15
