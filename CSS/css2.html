    <h1>Seahorses
        Fish
    </h1>
    <p>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
        This article is about the genus of fish. For the creature in mythology, see Hippocampus (mythology). For other
        uses, see Seahorse (disambiguation).
        Seahorses
        Temporal range: Lower Miocene to present – 23–0 Ma
        PreꞒꞒOSDCPTJKPgN
        A seahorse (also written sea-horse and sea horse) is any of 46 species of small marine fish in the genu
        s Hippocampus. "Hippocampus" comes from the Ancient Greek hippókampos (ἱππόκαμπος), itself from híppos (ἵππος)
        meaning "horse" and kámpos (κάμπος) meaning "sea monster"[4][5] or "sea animal".[6] Having a head and neck
        suggestive of a horse, seahorses also feature segmented bony armour, an upright posture and a curled prehensile
        tail.[7] Along with the pipefishes and seadragons (Phycodurus and Phyllopteryx) they form the family
        Syngnathidae.</p>
    <h2>Habitat</h2>
    <p>Seahorses are mainly found in shallow tropical and temperate salt water throughout the world, from about 45°S to
        45°N.[8] They live in sheltered areas such as seagrass beds, estuaries, coral reefs, and mangroves. Four species
        are found in Pacific waters from North America to South America. In the Atlantic, Hippocampus erectus ranges
        from Nova Scotia to Uruguay. H. zosterae, known as the dwarf seahorse, is found in the Bahamas.

        Colonies have been found in European waters such as the Thames Estuary.[9]

        Three species live in the Mediterranean Sea: H. guttulatus (the long-snouted seahorse), H. hippocampus (the
        short-snouted seahorse), and H. fuscus (the sea pony). These species form territories; males stay within 1 m2
        (10 sq ft) of habitat, while females range over about one hundred times that.</p>
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Seahorses range in size from 1.5 to 35 cm (0.6 to 13.8 in).[10] They are named for their equine appearance, with
        bent necks and long snouted heads and a distinctive trunk and tail. Although they are bony fish, they do not
        have scales, but rather thin skin stretched over a series of bony plates, which are arranged in rings throughout
        their bodies. Each species has a distinct number of rings.[11] The armor of bony plates also protects them
        against predators,[12] and because of this outer skeleton, they no longer have ribs.[13] </p>
    <h3>Evolution and fossil record</h3>
    <p>Anatomical evidence, supported by molecular, physical, and genetic evidence, demonstrates that seahorses are
        highly modified pipefish. The fossil record of seahorses, however, is very sparse. The best known and best
        studied fossils are specimens of Hippocampus guttulatus (though literature more commonly refers to them under
        the synonym of H. ramulosus), from the Marecchia River formation of Rimini Province, Italy, dating back to the
        Lower Pliocene, about 3 million years ago. The earliest known seahorse fossils are of two pipefish-like species,
        H. sarmaticus and H. slovenicus, from the coprolitic horizon of Tunjice Hills, a middle Miocene lagerstätte in
        Slovenia dating back about 13 million years.[19]</p>
