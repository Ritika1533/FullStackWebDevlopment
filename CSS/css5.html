        The Rod of Asclepius, a common symbol for medicine and health care
        Medicine is the science[1] and practice[2] of caring for a patient, managing the diagnosis, prognosis,
        prevention, treatment, palliation of their injury or disease, and promoting their health. Medicine encompasses a
        variety of health care practices evolved to maintain and restore health by the prevention and treatment of
        illness. Contemporary medicine applies biomedical sciences, biomedical research, genetics, and medical
        technology to diagnose, treat, and prevent injury and disease, typically through pharmaceuticals or surgery, but
        also through therapies as diverse as psychotherapy, external splints and traction, medical devices, biologics,
        and ionizing radiation, amongst others.[3]

        Medicine has been practiced since prehistoric times, and for most of this time it was an art (an area of
        creativity and skill), frequently having connections to the religious and philosophical beliefs of local
        culture. For example, a medicine man would apply herbs and say prayers for healing, or an ancient philosopher
        and physician would apply bloodletting according to the theories of humorism. In recent centuries, since the
        advent of modern science, most medicine has become a combination of art and science (both basic and applied,
        under the umbrella of medical science). For example, while stitching technique for sutures is an art learned
        through practice, knowledge of what happens at the cellular and molecular level in the tissues being stitched
        arises through science.

        Prescientific forms of medicine, now known as traditional medicine or folk medicine, remain commonly used in the
        absence of scientific medicine and are thus called alternative medicine. Alternative treatments outside of
        scientific medicine with safety and efficacy concerns are termed quackery.

        Etymology
        Medicine (UK: /ˈmɛdsɪn/ (listen), US: /ˈmɛdɪsɪn/ (listen)) is the science and practice of the diagnosis,
        prognosis, treatment, and prevention of disease.[4][5] The word "medicine" is derived from Latin medicus,
        meaning "a physician".[6][7]

        Clinical practice
        Oil painting of medicine in the age of colonialism
        The Doctor by Sir Luke Fildes (1891)

        Elizabeth Blackwell, the first female physician in the United States graduated from SUNY Upstate (1847)
        Medical availability and clinical practice vary across the world due to regional differences in culture and
        technology. Modern scientific medicine is highly developed in the Western world, while in developing countries
        such as parts of Africa or Asia, the population may rely more heavily on traditional medicine with limited
        evidence and efficacy and no required formal training for practitioners.[8]

        In the developed world, evidence-based medicine is not universally used in clinical practice; for example, a
        2007 survey of literature reviews found that about 49% of the interventions lacked sufficient evidence to
        support either benefit or harm.[9]

        In modern clinical practice, physicians and physician assistants personally assess patients to diagnose,
        prognose, treat, and prevent disease using clinical judgment. The doctor-patient relationship typically begins
        with an interaction with an examination of the patient's medical history and medical record, followed by a
        medical interview[10] and a physical examination. Basic diagnostic medical devices (e.g., stethoscope, tongue
        depressor) are typically used. After examining for signs and interviewing for symptoms, the doctor may order
        medical tests (e.g., blood tests), take a biopsy, or prescribe pharmaceutical drugs or other therapies.
        Differential diagnosis methods help to rule out conditions based on the information provided. During the
        encounter, properly informing the patient of all relevant facts is an important part of the relationship and the
        development of trust. The medical encounter is then documented in the medical record, which is a legal document
        in many jurisdictions.[11] Follow-ups may be shorter but follow the same general procedure, and specialists
        follow a similar process. The diagnosis and treatment may take only a few minutes or a few weeks, depending on
        the complexity of the issue.

        The components of the medical interview[10] and encounter are:

        Chief complaint (CC): the reason for the current medical visit. These are the symptoms. They are in the
        patient's own words and are recorded along with the duration of each one. Also called chief concern or
        presenting complaint.
        Current activity: occupation, hobbies, what the patient actually does.
        Family history (FH): listing of diseases in the family that may impact the patient. A family tree is sometimes
        used.
        History of present illness (HPI): the chronological order of events of symptoms and further clarification of
        each symptom. Distinguishable from history of previous illness, often called past medical history (PMH). Medical
        history comprises HPI and PMH.
        Medications (Rx): what drugs the patient takes including prescribed, over-the-counter, and home remedies, as
        well as alternative and herbal medicines or remedies. Allergies are also recorded.
        Past medical history (PMH/PMHx): concurrent medical problems, past hospitalizations and operations, injuries,
        past infectious diseases or vaccinations, history of known allergies.
        Review of systems (ROS) or systems inquiry: a set of additional questions to ask, which may be missed on HPI: a
        general enquiry (have you noticed any weight loss, change in sleep quality, fevers, lumps and bumps? etc.),
        followed by questions on the body's main organ systems (heart, lungs, digestive tract, urinary tract, etc.).
        Social history (SH): birthplace, residences, marital history, social and economic status, habits (including
        diet, medications, tobacco, alcohol).
        The physical examination is the examination of the patient for medical signs of disease that are objective and
        observable, in contrast to symptoms that are volunteered by the patient and are not necessarily objectively
        observable.[12] The healthcare provider uses sight, hearing, touch, and sometimes smell (e.g., in infection,
        uremia, diabetic ketoacidosis). Four actions are the basis of physical examination: inspection, palpation
        (feel), percussion (tap to determine resonance characteristics), and auscultation (listen), generally in that
        order, although auscultation occurs prior to percussion and palpation for abdominal assessments.[13]</p>
